How to play the game
--------------------

The game consists of a grid with cells. The main objective is to set all green cells 1 value and 0 the
red ones. When the user presses a cell, then it will switch the value of the marked ones to the opposite
value.

Up there is a chronometer and the number of pressed buttons (or value changes). The less time you solve
the puzzle and the less are the number of pressed, the better.

###Puzzle mode

This game mode is quite simple. Just you need to solve all the puzzles. If you solve one, you can jump
to the next (in the free version, the number of puzzles are the half of the total which you can play).

There are several colors in the menu:

* Red: The puzzle is blocked

* Green: Is unlocked

* Orange: You have solved the puzzle but too slow or with a high number of switches

* Blue: You have solved the puzzle within the optimal time and number of switches

###Survival mode

You must solve a series of random puzzles in a time. Once is finished the time, your score will be
the number of puzzles solved within that time.
